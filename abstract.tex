The area of concurrent priority queues suffers two problems each of which we aim to alleviate in this paper. The first is an apparent split in the research community with two separate factions each representing their priority queues. These two sub communities, knowingly or not, have benchmarked against disjoint  groups of priority queues and don't reference each other in their respective work. The second is success, with a large number of new concurrent priority queues being published the task of a new researcher looking to find the state of the art has a hard time ahead of them. This problem is compounded by the apparent split in benchmarking and analysis with a researcher potentially landing in one of the two islands and never seeing the other. Our paper solves both of these issues with a comprehensive thorough analysis of concurrent priority queues, an open source implementation of each queue and the benchmarking framework using the DEF language, and a detailed topology of each priority queue so that a new researcher can quickly get up to speed on the area. This paper also attempts to make suggestions for particular use cases dependent on the task at hand for the practitioner reading this work.
